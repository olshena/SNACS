\arguments{
\item{snacsObj}{SNACSList object}

\item{proportionMissingPerSNP}{Numeric. Only SNPs with lower than this proportion of missing values are considered. Default is 0.4. Range is 0-1}

\item{proportionMissingPerCell}{Numeric. Only cells with lower than this proportion of missing values are considered. Default is 0.4. Range is 0-1}

\item{proportionMutatedPerSNP}{Numeric vector. Only SNPs having proportion of mutations within this range are considered. Default is c(0.05,0.95). Range is 0-1}

\item{proportionMutatedPerCell}{Numeric vector. Only cells having proportion of mutations within this range are considered. Default is c(0,1). Range is 0-1}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Prints information when running the method. Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
A SNACSList object
}
\description{
Filter out SNPs and cells which have many missing values in the mutation data. SNPs which are nearly all mutated or all unmutated are excluded.
